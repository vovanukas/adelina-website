  <h2 id="professional-attitude">Professional attitude:</h2>
<p>This term I will attend all classes prepared and show enthusiasm for projects. By the end of the term I will not have any missing parts of the assignments and not have any retakes. I will achieve this by setting deadlines for assignments and dedicating an hour everyday minimum to do them.</p>
<h2 id="collaborations">Collaborations:</h2>
<p>By the end of this term me and my team will have found a way to work smoothly together and hold each other accountable. This will be measured by the fact that we won’t have any missing parts of the project and will not need a retake.</p>
<h2 id="solution-oriented-action">Solution-Oriented Action:</h2>
<p>This term I will enhance my overall academic performance by regularly reviewing and revising study strategies, seeking feedback from professors or coaches, and adjusting approaches based on identified strengths and weaknesses, with the aim of achieving a cumulative GPA of 8 or higher by the end of the academic year.</p>
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership:</h2>
<p>This term I will take the leaders position in my group to ensure that work is done on time and that our projects aren’t missing anything. This will be measured by us having an 80 on every group project by the end of the term.</p>
<h2 id="performance-goals">Performance goals:</h2>
<p>Gpa of 8 or higher in order to graduate with merit or cum laude degree.
I will read 9 books this school year, that will be 1 book a month. This is so that I stay vigilant about maintaining my reading hobby and practise entertaining/relaxing without my phone.</p>
<h2 id="which-aspectsobjectives-have-you-already-made-progress-on">Which aspects/objectives have you already made progress on?</h2>
<p>So far, I have made minimal progress on actions needed to ensure I get 80, such as making to do lists and checklists to make sure I know what I need to deliver and so I can stay on track. I have started working on bettering the communication &amp; cooperation with my team. I encourage my team to aim for the good mark instead of satisfactory and if that doesn’t work - in our work checklists I write the requirements for the good grade as if they are the bare minimum. I find that it helps with the teams mindset. Additionally, I encourage the to take breaks after deadlines for a quick reset.</p>
<h2 id="which-aspectsobjectives-would-you-like-to-work-more">Which aspects/objectives would you like to work more?</h2>
<p>I would like to work more on staying focused on my goals and bettering communication with my team. As right now, I’m still just getting back into the pace of school work and am trying to figure out how to manage my work with school and hobbies.</p>
<h2 id="which-aspectsobjectives-are-a-challenge-for-you">Which aspects/objectives are a challenge for you?</h2>
<p>My biggest challenge right now is staying focused and determined to ensure I stay on track with school work. Right now is the beginning of the year and I’m struggling to get back into the work-flow but I’m working on it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-stopping-you-from-achieving-your-goals">What is stopping you from achieving your goals?</h2>
<p>Currently, what is stopping me from achieving my goals is lack of motivation, better communication and collaboration within the group.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-require-in-order-to-achieve-the-goals">What do you require in order to achieve the goals?</h2>
<p>To achieve my goals I must practise self-discipline and not rely on motivation to work towards them.  I need to make a detailed study plan and schedule which will ensure that I can maintain a good balance between studying, working, hobbies and socialising.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-planning-to-do">What are you planning to do?</h2>
<p>I plan to create a study strategy, improve communication with my team and practise self-discipline to avoid procrastination.</p>
