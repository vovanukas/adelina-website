<li>My goal is to learn what it’s like to work in an office environment in a team of people when organizing a marketing campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Action plan:</strong>
During my three day work placement I will collaborate with the marketing department at Litpersona to create marketing plan for expansion into Greenland. My goals are to write three posts for their facebook account and three advertisements that they can run on facebook. After that, I need to communicate with graphic designer on what sort of visuals those posts and ads need.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment:</strong>
Greenland marketing plan. Three posts for the new facebook account, three ads that can be ran on it, getting visuals from graphic designer.</li>
<li><strong>How it went:</strong>
The first day began with a briefing with the marketing manager, they explained to me what the current work goal is, how they want to present the company and what they need from me. After the briefing, I started research into Greenland and created a media plan. Once I got approval, I moved on to create the three introductory posts for their new business facebook account. Next day, I showed them to marketing manager who gave me feedback and I adjusted them accordingly. That same day, we wrote three ads for facebook together and contacted the graphic designer to create visuals for all six posts/ads. On the third day, we assembled everything together and scheduled the posts.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong>
The feedback I got was overall positive, I did all the tasks we had discussed on time, they were good quality and didn’t require many iterations. I got feedback on my copywriting skills and that I should work on writing more concisely.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion to the goals:</strong>
I learnt what it means to work within a whole marketing team when developing a marketing campaign. How many checks and approvals a simple facebook post needs to go through before you can even start developing visuals and how many more iterations need to happen afterwards. Also, I learnt how to communicate within an office and how its not as formal as I imagined with workers preferring to send quick and straight to the point emails.</li>
