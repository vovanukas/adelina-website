  <h2 id="objective">Objective:</h2>
<p>This term I will enhance my overall academic performance by regularly reviewing and revising study strategies, seeking feedback from professors or coaches, and adjusting approaches based on identified strengths and weaknesses, with the aim of achieving a cumulative GPA of 8 or higher by the end of the academic year.</p>
<h2 id="acting-out">Acting out:</h2>
<p>This year I want to figure out the most efficient and productive way of studying that’s interactive and fun to do so that I’m less likely to procrastinate. I want to focus on learning new things and growing as a creative business professional. I want to try make school work into a seamless part of my day that doesn’t feel like a chore but more similar to a hobby. My goal is to have a GPA of 8 by the end of the year.</p>
<h2 id="reflect">Reflect:</h2>
<p>This year, I set up a Trello for myself and my groups so that our tasks are more tangible and it’s easier to track progress. I sought out feedback from my coaches and team mates so I know how I can improve my leadership style <a href="//localhost:1313/appendices/trainings/leadership-style-training/">see appendix 5</a>. I didn’t achieve a cumulative GPA of 8, but 7.7. Also, I tried different learning techniques such as POMODORO, going to school on my days off, study groups. From trying out all these different ways of boosting my productivity, I learnt that the best way to study for me is early in the morning and late at night at home in complete silence. This is because I get easily distracted by good weather, sounds and people talking around me (see challenge journal 4). Overall, I achieved this objective halfway, but I learnt a lot about myself. I thought that I really dislike learning, that it’s boring, but in reality I dislike the pressure of succeeding from first try. I feel like I was putting to much pressure on myself to know everything right away, when that’s just not possible. I learnt that I actually really enjoy learning new things and how to do them. I felt my most productive when I could see myself improve in things like finance. Even though, I wan’t fully successful in this objective, I feel like it was productive and took some pressure of off me.</p>
<h2 id="awareness">Awareness:</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned from this experience that, because I get easily distracted by outside stimuli, my most productive study times are early in the morning and late at night in total silence. While trying out strategies like study groups and the POMODORO method was helpful, I discovered that learning was more pleasurable when there was less of an immediate pressure to succeed. I discovered that I like tracking my development, particularly in areas like finance. In the future, I&rsquo;ll create a disciplined study schedule for when I&rsquo;m most productive, make reasonable goals, and include interactive components in my coursework. To increase productivity and strive for an 8 GPA at the end of my degree at Inholland, I will implement these startegies into the rest of my studies.</p>
<h2 id="action-plan">Action plan:</h2>
<p>I will make a structured study schedule for early mornings and late nights that line up with my most productive times in order to improve my study habits. To make studying more fun, I&rsquo;ll use interactive learning resources and study groups. I&rsquo;ll also apply the POMODORO technique to balance concentrated study sessions with regular breaks. I will also ask classmates and coaches for feedback on a regular basis so that I can keep improving. In order to increase productivity and work towards finishing my studies with an 8 GPA, my objective is to put these strategies into practice in the years To get the best results, I&rsquo;ll concentrate on implementing these adjustments into my minor and internship.</p>
<h2 id="smart-goal-for-next-year">SMART Goal for next year:</h2>
<p>I want to improve my study habits the next year. I&rsquo;m going to make a study schedule that is organised around my most productive times, use study groups and interactive learning resources, apply the POMODORO technique, ask for regular feedback, and use these strategies for  my minor and internship in order to aim for a GPA of 8 at the end of my studies.</p>
