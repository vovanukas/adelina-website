<div class="content">
  <h2 id="objective">Objective:</h2>
<p>This year I will take the leaders position in my group to ensure that work is done on time and that our projects aren’t missing anything. This will be measured by us having an 80 on every group project by the end of the term.</p>
<h2 id="acting-out">Acting out:</h2>
<p>This year I want to be a leader in my teams and make sure we submit everything on time, pass all assignments with a high grade. I want to focus on ensure good time and project management within my groups. I want to try being a good leader that brings their team to success.</p>
<h2 id="reflect">Reflect:</h2>
<p>I was the general manager and leader of both teams I was in this year. I made sure we submitted fully complete assignments on time, aiming for a good grade each time. I set up Trello and deadlines for everyone so that we can stay on track and monitor our progress. Other’s followed those deadlines and made us of Trello to select what parts they want to do for every assignment <a href="/appendices/trainings/negotiation-training/">see appendix 10</a>. The effect of my actions was that we had an organized group structure, everyone knew what, how and when they had to do. We never missed a deadline or lacked anything in our reports. We also got a couple of 90’s and 80’s, but also a 60. That is what I wanted to achieve apart from the 60, but it was our first assignment working together and we were still learning how to collaborate <a href="/appendices/trainings/cross-cultural-management-training/">see appendix 9</a>. I was mostly thinking about how can we complete everything on time and in a way that meets grading coaches expectations. I wanted to try out different leadership styles, which I did <a href="/appendices/trainings/leadership-style-training/">see appendix 5</a>. This year I mostly implemented the visionary and democratic styles, which worked for some team mates, but not others - they needed stricter leadership figure (see challenge journal 2). I also tried to advise my team mates on how to best do their parts if I saw that they were stuck <a href="/appendices/trainings/advisory-skills-training/">see appendix 11</a>. I was thinking about how to make sure everyone does their best, this included putting more pressure on some team members and letting others do everything on their own accord if that seemed like it would help them. I enjoyed being the leader, but it also caused me additional stress because I had to be the one who is running after procrastinating team mates, asking them to do their parts on time. At times like those, I really didn’t want to lead anyone.</p>
<h2 id="awareness">Awareness:</h2>
<p>This experience taught me how to set deadlines, use Trello to facilitate clear organisation and communication, and improve team performance to finish projects on time. One-size-fits-all leadership doesn&rsquo;t work for everyone, so I must modify my style to fit the needs of various team members. Even though I enjoyed being a leader, there was more stress involved, particularly when dealing with disorganised team members. Overall, I learned the value of structured project management, the necessity of effective stress management to meet team objectives, and the significance of flexibility in leadership.</p>
<h2 id="action-plan">Action plan:</h2>
<p>I could use a situational leadership approach, do frequent feedback sessions, assign work more skillfully, organise more team-building activities, and use a conflict resolution framework to enhance my leadership and team management. These alternatives have the following benefits: greater accountability, improved team member happiness, increased flexibility, improved cooperation within the team, and successful conflict resolution. They do, however, need patience, work, and flexibility. The next time, I&rsquo;ll better delegate, schedule frequent feedback sessions, and adjust my leadership style to suit the needs of each team member. By the end of my next team project, I want to improve my teamwork and get better grades. During my minor and internship modules, I will concentrate on putting these strategies into practice.</p>
<h2 id="smart-goal-for-next-year">SMART Goal for next year:</h2>
<p>Through the implementation of a situational leadership approach, frequent feedback sessions, and improved delegation within my teams, I aim to further develop my leadership skills by the end of the next school year. Additionally, I will make sure that all assignments are turned in on time and that my team receives an average grade of 80 or higher during my minor.</p>
