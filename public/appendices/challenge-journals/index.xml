      <description>Challenge: Managing time for work, school, hobbies and social life to minimize stress without sacrificing quality of either.&#xA;WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO? What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new? I tried scheduling out my days in hours, maximising my productivity. For example if I know I have my workout class at 12 - I wake up at 8 and do my work until its time to leave at 11, then on my way there and back I also do some small tasks such as replying to comments/messages.</description>

      <description>CHALLANGE: Struggling to keep up with personal development portfolio, export plan, financial plan, export research and prepare for the financial exam as well as get good grades in all. This is made harder with the distraction of good spring weather.&#xA;WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO? What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new? I tried dedicating full days for just one of the reports, I tried doing one task for every report everyday, I tried dedicating afternoons to school work and morning for work and personal hobbies, tried doing assignments in the line of deadlines but nothing really sticks or works to the extend for it to become a go to method.</description>
