  <h2 id="challange">CHALLANGE:</h2>
<p>Struggling to keep up with personal development portfolio, export plan, financial plan, export research and prepare for the financial exam as well as get good grades in all. This is made harder with the distraction of good spring weather.</p>
<h2 id="which-activities-have-you-attempted-and-how-did-the-execution-go">WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO?</h2>
<h3 id="what-was-worthwhile-what-did-you-discover-what-surprised-you-which-insights-were-new">What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new?</h3>
<p>I tried dedicating full days for just one of the reports, I tried doing one task for every report everyday, I tried dedicating afternoons to school work and morning for work and personal hobbies, tried doing assignments in the line of deadlines but nothing really sticks or works to the extend for it to become a go to method. I thinking dedicating extra time to the reports for which deadline is approaching is worthwhile, I try to get them out of the way as fast as possible. Also, switching between the reports when I hit a wall or it becomes to boring and I start to become distracted.</p>
<h2 id="flow-moments">FLOW MOMENTS</h2>
<h3 id="at-which-moments-or-during-which-activities-andor-assignments-were-you-in-your-flow-what-were-nice-or-positive-experiences">At which moments or during which activities and/or assignments were you in your flow? What were nice or positive experiences?</h3>
<p>I’m in a flow when I know I have a full day that I can dedicate to writing reports. In that case I will wake up, drink a coffee and sit down and start working on one of the deadlines, taking productive breaks such as cleaning something in my apartment, doing an easier task for some report, practising finance definitions. It’s nice when a task is finished and I can check it off my checklist, gives a boost of motivation and reminds me that I can do it and it’ manageable.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-received">FEEDBACK RECEIVED</h2>
<h3 id="what-feedback-positive-or-negative-was-interesting-for-you-and-were-you-able-to-use-it-further-on">What feedback (positive or negative) was interesting for you? and were you able to use it further on?</h3>
<p>I haven’t really received much feedback yet, but probably that I have a very structured approach to doing reports.</p>
<h2 id="successes-and-compliments">SUCCESSES AND COMPLIMENTS</h2>
<h3 id="what-were-your-most-important-successes-and-compliments">What were your most important successes and compliments?</h3>
<p>Finishing everything on time, without sacrificing any aspect of life and reports.</p>
<h2 id="development">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<h3 id="in-what-area-especially-did-you-develop-yourself-looking-back">In what area especially did you develop yourself, looking back?</h3>
<p>Managing my stress levels, time management and project management since I’m also the general manager of my team and have to make sure they do everything on time and correctly.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-find-especially-fun-or-interesting-to-learn">What did you find especially fun or interesting to learn?</h3>
<p>How good I’m at multi-tasking.</p>
<h3 id="what-else-would-you-like-to-investigate-engage-in-and-try-out">What else would you like to investigate, engage in and try out?</h3>
<p>Nothing really.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-you-find-difficult-what-stood-in-your-way">WHAT DID YOU FIND DIFFICULT? WHAT STOOD IN YOUR WAY?</h2>
<h3 id="when-and-during-which-activities-and-assignments-or-moments-did-you-experience-tension-boredom-or-other-obstacles">When and during which activities and assignments or moments did you experience tension, boredom or other obstacles?</h3>
<p>In beginning of May I was very burned out and had a small breakdown from all the stress and responsibilities I have to manage, I let myself take a few days off and now it’s better and I’m productive again.</p>
<h2 id="resources">RESOURCES</h2>
<h3 id="what-were-the-key-resources-during-the-experimentation-who-or-what-helped-you-to-feel-good-develop-insights-experience-flow-and-achieve-your-goal">What were the key resources during the experimentation? Who or what helped you to feel good, develop insights experience flow and achieve your goal?</h3>
<p>My main resources are my boyfriend who I live with, my parents and my workouts during which I can just forget about everything else for an hour. Also, looking forward to the summer and all the holidays I will take helps me stay motivated to pass everything on time and with good grades.</p>
