  <h2 id="challange">CHALLANGE:</h2>
<p>Lack of initiative and work ethic from other students which leads to group’s work being delayed, causes a lot of stress and uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="which-activities-have-you-attempted-and-how-did-the-execution-go">WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO?</h2>
<h3 id="what-was-worthwhile-what-did-you-discover-what-surprised-you-which-insights-were-new">What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new?</h3>
<p>I attempted to talk to that team mate, raising my concerns. It was met with acknowledgement of the problem but refusal to adjust behaviour. She refused to adhere to collaboration contract stating that she might be late for our groups deadlines by a month but she has never caused us to miss school’s deadlines. She said that our group didn’t feel like a group and that I should give more positive affirmations and not just criticism. To me this is ridiculous - of course our group doesn’t feel like a group when she’s never at school, also, what am I supposed to compliment her on? Missing deadlines by a month? What was worthwhile is finally letting out all the build up frustruation, but unfortunately I didn’t get any new insights nor discover anything new. Just the same excuses all over again.</p>
<h2 id="flow-moments">FLOW MOMENTS</h2>
<h3 id="at-which-moments-or-during-which-activities-andor-assignments-were-you-in-your-flow-what-were-nice-or-positive-experiences">At which moments or during which activities and/or assignments were you in your flow? What were nice or positive experiences?</h3>
<p>I was in a flow when I was doing my individual assignment. It was nice not having to rely on anyone and being able to do tasks on my own time and terms.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-received">FEEDBACK RECEIVED</h2>
<h3 id="what-feedback-positive-or-negative-was-interesting-for-you-and-were-you-able-to-use-it-further-on">What feedback (positive or negative) was interesting for you? and were you able to use it further on?</h3>
<p>Feedback was mostly positive, the main negative feedback was that I should be more understanding and complimentary. Which I was for whole 6 months yet I never got that in return. I wish someone understood how frustrating it is to rely on her and have her let me down time after time for 6 months. You cannot expect understanding without extending it to others. The most self centered person I have ever met.</p>
<h2 id="successes-and-compliments">SUCCESSES AND COMPLIMENTS</h2>
<h3 id="what-were-your-most-important-successes-and-compliments">What were your most important successes and compliments?</h3>
<p>The most important success was getting an 80 on the first assignment after retake. Compliments to me about my collaboration, initiative, ambition and time management skills were the most important to me.</p>
<h2 id="development">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<h3 id="in-what-area-especially-did-you-develop-yourself-looking-back">In what area especially did you develop yourself, looking back?</h3>
<p>I developed a better backbone, from now I will not be as lenient to people who don’t respect set rules and others.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-find-especially-fun-or-interesting-to-learn">What did you find especially fun or interesting to learn?</h3>
<p>I found it interesting to learn more about myself, how forgiving I am. As for the project itself, it was interesting to work with New L.oak and network with web developers. Learn more about pricing and what goes on behind the screen we see.</p>
<h3 id="what-else-would-you-like-to-investigate-engage-in-and-try-out">What else would you like to investigate, engage in and try out?</h3>
<p>In the next term I would like to try being more strict about collaboration contracts and show that not following the agreed upon rules has consequences (warning -&gt; yellow card &gt; red card).</p>
<h2 id="what-did-you-find-difficult-what-stood-in-your-way">WHAT DID YOU FIND DIFFICULT? WHAT STOOD IN YOUR WAY?</h2>
<h3 id="when-and-during-which-activities-and-assignments-or-moments-did-you-experience-tension-boredom-or-other-obstacles">When and during which activities and assignments or moments did you experience tension, boredom or other obstacles?</h3>
<p>I found the whole semester challenging as my team was unmotivated and I could rely only on two teammates at the end of the module.</p>
<h2 id="resources">RESOURCES</h2>
<h3 id="what-were-the-key-resources-during-the-experimentation-who-or-what-helped-you-to-feel-good-develop-insights-experience-flow-and-achieve-your-goal">What were the key resources during the experimentation? Who or what helped you to feel good, develop insights experience flow and achieve your goal?</h3>
<p>My key resources were my coaches who supported and helped me with assignments, they validated my feelings as they have observed the struggles and ensured me that it is okay to have boundaries.</p>
