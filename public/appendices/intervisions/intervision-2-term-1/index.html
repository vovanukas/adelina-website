  <h2 id="question-chosen">Question chosen:</h2>
<p>Maxim’s “How can I efficiently navigate a situation where I&rsquo;ve engaged a freelancer for a project task, yet I&rsquo;m uncertain about our budget allocation from the client?”</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation:</h2>
<p>The question shows Maxim&rsquo;s worry regarding the efficient administration of a freelancer-led project, considering the unpredictability of project budget and schedule. Maxim is concerned about:
Communication with freelancer: Maxim has engaged a freelancer to complete a project task, but he is uncertain if the client&rsquo;s budget will allow for the freelancer&rsquo;s fees.
Project Timelines: Because of financial limitations and other uncertainties, Maxim worries that the team might miss the three-week delivery deadline that was promised.
Client Expectations: Maxim does not want to let the client down by not finishing the project on schedule and within the predetermined budget.</p>
<h2 id="informative-questions">Informative questions:</h2>
<p>What tools did you use to better the communication? (calling in google workplace)
Did you communicate your uncertainties to him? (no
Did communicating in your native language help? (yes, but still feeling of uncertainty)</p>
<h2 id="key-words-of-the-problem">Key words of the problem:</h2>
<p>Wasting freelancers time
Uncertainty</p>
<h2 id="problem-analysis">Problem analysis:</h2>
<p>Maxim feels like he is being unfair to the freelancer by dragging him aloong without knowing if we for sure can afford to pay him. He struggles with balancing clients finances with freelancers time and work. In order to meet deadlines, navigate financial uncertainty, and align client expectations while optimising use of resources and minimising risks of disappointment or inefficiency, Maxim must possess strong communication, negotiation, and strategic decision-making skills.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice:</h2>
<p>Establish Reasonable Expectations: Control client expectations by describing potential obstacles in detail and, if necessary, by talking about alternate deadlines or deliverables.
Keep a close eye on progress: To guarantee that the project stays within the set budget and schedule, keep a careful check on its advancement and costs. Adapt as necessary to stay on course.
Maintain Backup Plans: Make backup plans in case there are unanticipated difficulties or delays. This can entail using different tactics or methods to complete the project on schedule and within budget.
Frequent Communication: Throughout the project, keep lines of communication open and frequent with the client and the freelancer. Describe the status of the project, the challenges encountered, and any changes made to guarantee openness and consistency.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>
<p>Due to project constraints and payment uncertainty, Maxim&rsquo;s shows feelings of unfairness towards the freelancer. Maxim should prioritise having open lines of communication with the client and the freelancer, control expectations, and refrain from overcommitting to tight deadlines and hidden costs in order to overcome these difficulties. Maxim can effectively manage the project while reducing risks and maximising resource utilisation by encouraging openness and strategic decision-making.</p>
