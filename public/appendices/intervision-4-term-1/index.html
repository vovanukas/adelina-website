  <h2 id="question-chosen">Question chosen:</h2>
<p>Hamza’s “How can we effectively navigate moments of tension and uncertainty during the ideation phase to generate ideas and transform them into a coherent concept?”</p>
<h2 id="question-explanation">Question Explanation:</h2>
<p>How can tension and uncertainty be managed during the idea generation stage to produce concepts that are meaningful and clear? In order to guarantee that original ideas can be developed into a coherent project concept, Hamza is looking for solutions for handling problems like conflicts or ambiguity that frequently occur during creative brainstorming.</p>
<h2 id="informative-questions">Informative questions:</h2>
<p>Did you try creative thinking techniques?(yes, that went okay, but client constrains cause a creative block, since you cant let yourself be fully creative - knowing that the client cannot afford it, hard to turn idea into concept)
Using AI? (no)
Is it usually like this or just during this project? (sometimes, takes time to get into a pace from the blank state,</p>
<h2 id="problem-analysis">Problem analysis:</h2>
<p>In order to produce concepts that are meaningful and clear, Hamza&rsquo;s questions what are the best ways to handle conflict and uncertainty during the ideation stage. The intention is to ensure that innovative ideas can develop into convincing  project concepts by addressing the conflicts and ambiguity that are common in creative brainstorming. Hamza is faced with limitations where the client&rsquo;s restrictions on practicality prevent him from thinking creatively. This problem isn&rsquo;t specific to any one project; it frequently takes him some time to get into a productive rhythm when starting from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="key-words-of-the-problem">Key words of the problem:</h2>
<p>Stress
Overwhelmed
Creative block
Tension
uncertainty</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice:</h2>
<p>When discussing the ideation process with clients and teammates, be sure to set reasonable expectations. Don’t forget the importance of experimentation and reworking ideas until you have practical concepts.
Encourage open discussion and teamwork within the team and clients. By exchanging perspectives, ideas and identifying points of agreement, this might help in navigating conflicts and uncertainties.
Experiment with using AI to get inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>
<p>Hamza&rsquo;s goal is to resolve disagreements and uncertainty during ideation in order to convert unique concepts into cohesive project ideas.
He is constrained by client requirements that prevent him from expressing himself fully creatively, which causes tension and blocks his creativity.
In order to promote original and compelling project concepts, it&rsquo;s important to address stress, creative blocks, and uncertainty.
To effectively manage conflicts and maximise idea development, Hamza should place a high priority on establishing reasonable expectations, promoting open communication, experimenting with AI tools for inspiration, and accepting continuous improvement.</p>
