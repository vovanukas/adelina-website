  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We studied the framework of productive conflict management during this training, focusing on crucial phases for successful resolution (Rossingol, 2023):</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening: Outlining the purpose of the meeting, establishing shared objectives, gauging willingness to solve problems, and developing a schedule.</li>
<li>Investigation: Paying attention, examining concepts and objectives, converting grievances into possible remedies, and maintaining focus on the ultimate objective.</li>
<li>Negotiation: coming up with potential solutions, reaching agreements to stop future disputes, and clearly recording agreements through documentation.</li>
<li>Closing: Verifying that everyone is happy with the result and setting up additional meetings to gauge the sustainability of the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we studied fundamental ideas like the nature of conflict, the Thomas-Kilmann conflict model, and the effects of unresolved disputes (Management Training Specialists, 2022). In order to improve self-awareness and conflict resolution abilities, practical exercises included emotional agility practice and reflection on one&rsquo;s own emotional struggles.</p>
<h2 id="suitability-assesment">Suitability assesment</h2>
<p>Thinking back on this instruction, I see how directly it relates to personal development. Through the implementation of structured conflict resolution processes and the development of emotional intelligence, I have improved my ability to manage conflicts and cultivate positive relationships. I will be better able to handle difficult situations with poise and clarity because of the emphasis on emotional agility and self-awareness.</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key points</h2>
<p>Conflict Resolution Skills: Using organised conflict resolution methods to settle disputes amicably.</p>
<p>Improving self-awareness and emotional elasticity to control emotions in conflict and stressful circumstances is known as emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>Time management and work-life balance: To attain a healthy work-life balance, prioritise tasks, establish boundaries, and maximise productivity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I gained vital skills from this training that will aid in my personal growth, emotional stability, and efficient conflict resolution. I can successfully navigate conflicts and lead fulfilling lives by using structured conflict resolution techniques, developing emotional intelligence, and placing a high priority on work-life balance.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-about-where-i-have-had-difficulties-handling-my-emotions">Exercise about where i have had difficulties handling my emotions:</h2>
<ol>
<li><u>Where were you?</u> On an airplane</li>
<li><u>Was there anyone else involved?</u> Yes, it was me and the passenger behind me</li>
<li><u>What happened?</u> It was a 16 hour flight, and her daughter was sitting behind me, kicking my chair and not letting me lower my chair even when the person in front of me did so to me - I had less leg room.</li>
<li><u>What was going through your mind?</u> I was tired, annoyed and angry because my trip at that point had lasted 20 hours and I couldn’t get any sleep, meanwhile she and her daughter were relaxing and not thinking about anyone else.</li>
<li><u>What kind of reaction did you have?</u> I didn’t say anything apart from complaining to my boyfriend.</li>
<li><u>What did you think of your reaction at the time?</u> I think I should have said something and asked her to stop.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercise-intervision-session">Exercise: intervision session</h2>
<h3 id="7-steps-method">7 steps method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fabio lacks time to work, study, travel and have social life</li>
<li>The difficulty Fabio faces is juggling several significant facets of life in a constrained amount of time:</li>
</ol>
<p>Work: Meeting obligations and responsibilities in the workplace.</p>
<p>Study: Commitment to classes and assignments.</p>
<p>Travel: Scheduling time for travel to school and work.</p>
<p>Social Life: Building connections and taking part in social events.</p>
<p>Due to his time constraints, Fabio finds it challenging to divide his time and energy between these responsibilities, which cause stress, exhaustion, and an unbalanced feeling. In order to achieve a more sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle, this challenge emphasises the need for prioritisation, efficient time management, and possibly reevaluating commitments. Achieving a healthy work-life balance, defining reasonable goals, and optimising time management are crucial factors to take into account.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What exactly does he have to balance? What stands in his way? Is he willing to sacrifice anything for this current moment?</li>
<li>A very frequent problem with which most of students will have to deal with at some point. Hard to help another person solve this, as it’s incredibly personal and requires sacrifices that only they can come up with.</li>
<li>Make it obvious when to draw boundaries between personal time and work/study hours. To promote a better work-life balance, try to avoid taking work home with you whenever you can. Make self-care a priority in order to preserve general wellbeing and productivity. This includes getting enough sleep, exercising, and relaxing.Be adaptable and ready to change your plans or priorities in response to input and evolving conditions.</li>
<li>Overall, by emphasising self-care and striking a healthy balance between work, study, travel, and social life, Fabio can manage his time more effectively, experience less stress, and lead a more fulfilling life.</li>
