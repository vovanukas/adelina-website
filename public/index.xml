      <description>Summary In this advising training session, we looked at the ideas and theories that support good communication and advice-giving. We talked about how important it is to take into account a number of variables when providing advice, such as self-awareness, knowing the client&amp;rsquo;s needs, and making sure communication is clear and efficient (Purdue University, n.d.). In order to guarantee the quality and acceptance of advice, we looked at possible communication risks and strategies to avoid them.</description>

      <description>Challenge: Managing time for work, school, hobbies and social life to minimize stress without sacrificing quality of either.&#xA;WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO? What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new? I tried scheduling out my days in hours, maximising my productivity. For example if I know I have my workout class at 12 - I wake up at 8 and do my work until its time to leave at 11, then on my way there and back I also do some small tasks such as replying to comments/messages.</description>

We also talked about how to improve the effectiveness of negotiations through the use of research from psychology and communication studies in our strategic questioning techniques.</description>
