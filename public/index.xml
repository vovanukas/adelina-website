      <description>Challenge: Managing time for work, school, hobbies and social life to minimize stress without sacrificing quality of either.&#xA;WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO? What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new? I tried scheduling out my days in hours, maximising my productivity. For example if I know I have my workout class at 12 - I wake up at 8 and do my work until its time to leave at 11, then on my way there and back I also do some small tasks such as replying to comments/messages.</description>
