## Question chosen: 
Rupina’s - “how could she manage time to less affect the groups work flow?”

## Background questions for her:

How do you manage your time right now?
What stands in your way to do assignments by our set deadlines?
What kind of accommodations would make sure you do your parts before deadlines?

## Key words of the problem:

Overwhelming
Stress
Chaos
Procrastination
Lack of motivation

## Advices:

Set timers for 30 minutes and keep adding another 30 minutes after one goes off. After an hour set a timer for 15 minute break. Then start again.
Start using trello, very satisfying and motivating to move tasks to the done section.

## Summary: 

We addressed and discussed Rupina’s issues. Discussion gave better insight into the reasons for her actions and she took accountability for how she makes other team mates feel. We gave her advice on how she could better manage her stress, work, time. She said she’d take it into account and adjust her behaviour. However, now that a month has passed since, no action to change was taken and she continues to delay and deliver unsatisfactory work.
