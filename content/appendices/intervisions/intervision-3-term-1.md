## Question chosen: 
Mine “How can I better manage my time to fit in work, school, hobbies and social life without sacrifising quality of each?”

## Question Explanation: 
My aim to successfully manage several significant facets of my life is reflected in the question.
Time management: To make the most of my free time, I want to effectively plan and arrange my tasks.
Work, School, Hobbies, and Social Life: I want to succeed in all of these areas, and they all demand my attention and dedication.
Preserving Quality: I work hard and set high expectations for myself in all I do, including work, school, hobbies, and social interactions.
I'm looking for ways to prioritise my work, manage my time well, and apply effective strategies so that I can succeed in all of these areas at once. This question captures my shared struggle of juggling a variety of obligations and passions in the pursuit of a happy, balanced lifestyle.

## Problem exploration: 
See [Challenge Journal 1](/appendices/challenge-journals/challenge-journal-term-1).

## Advice: 
Re-organize school work, don’t procrastinate, plan days hourly to fit in all responsibilities, do something productive everyday, if the deadline is 10th pretend its 8th so you do your work faster, use breaks at school to do assignments

## Summary:
Rearranging schoolwork, avoiding procrastination, carefully planning days, being productive every day, setting earlier deadlines for greater efficiency, and using school breaks for assignments are some strategies that were offered to me for achieving this balance. I will be aiming to maximise time use without sacrrifising quality across a variety of responsibilities and passions.
