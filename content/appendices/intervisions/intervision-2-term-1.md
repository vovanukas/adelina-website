He struggles with balancing clients finances with freelancers time and work. In order to meet deadlines, navigate financial uncertainty, and align client expectations while optimising use of resources and minimising risks of disappointment or inefficiency, Maxim must possess strong communication, negotiation, and strategic decision-making skills.

## Advice: 
Establish Reasonable Expectations: Control client expectations by describing potential obstacles in detail and, if necessary, by talking about alternate deadlines or deliverables.
Keep a close eye on progress: To guarantee that the project stays within the set budget and schedule, keep a careful check on its advancement and costs. Adapt as necessary to stay on course.
Maintain Backup Plans: Make backup plans in case there are unanticipated difficulties or delays. This can entail using different tactics or methods to complete the project on schedule and within budget.
Frequent Communication: Throughout the project, keep lines of communication open and frequent with the client and the freelancer. Describe the status of the project, the challenges encountered, and any changes made to guarantee openness and consistency.

## Summary:

Maxim should prioritise having open lines of communication with the client and the freelancer, control expectations, and refrain from overcommitting to tight deadlines and hidden costs in order to overcome these difficulties. Maxim can effectively manage the project while reducing risks and maximising resource utilisation by encouraging openness and strategic decision-making.
