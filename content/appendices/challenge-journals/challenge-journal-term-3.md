## CHALLANGE: 
Uncertainty about the assignment and how to meet high quality demands without an example before deadline.

## WHICH ACTIVITIES HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED AND HOW DID THE EXECUTION GO? 
### What was worthwhile? What did you discover? What surprised you? Which insights were new?
I have attempted to reach out to coaches get feedback from them on done parts. I have tried aiming for the good grade but for me its hard to accomplish within the strict word count. I also tried consulting with other teams, but they are also confused. It’s surprising to me that coaches expect such high quality deep research yet they set such strict word counts and say to put what doesn’t fit in appendix. In my opinion, if it still needs to be done then the word count should be changed and not everything over it be pushed into appendix.

## FLOW MOMENTS
### At which moments or during which activities and/or assignments were you in your flow? What were nice or positive experiences?
It’s nice that IB is a very structured module, there is a clear timeline and requirements. The coaches are helpful and do feedback sessions which ensures the highest quality of work.

## FEEDBACK RECEIVED
### What feedback (positive or negative) was interesting for you? and were you able to use it further on?
Most feedback I got was just to make small tweaks, expand some discussion, put stuff in appendix - it was helpful.

## SUCCESSES AND COMPLIMENTS
### What were your most important successes and compliments?
That my parts of the first project were all satisfactory and I didn’t need to re-do anything.

## DEVELOPMENT
### In what area especially did you develop yourself, looking back?
In managing how to present research as concisely as possible, how to structure a big report. How to use feedback.

### What did you find especially fun or interesting to learn?
It’s fun to have this one challenging module to further develop research, analysis, time management, critical thinking skills. 

### What else would you like to investigate, engage in and try out?
Nothing, I think this is pretty thorough module, that let me develop a lot of skills.

## WHAT DID YOU FIND DIFFICULT? WHAT STOOD IN YOUR WAY?
### When and during which activities and assignments or moments did you experience tension, boredom or other obstacles?
Some research is boring, cutting down the word count and figuring out what should be in main text versus appendix is boring and causes unnesseccary stress. 

## RESOURCES
### What were the key resources during the experimentation? Who or what helped you to feel good, develop insights experience flow and achieve your goal?
My coaches, trello software, google scholar.
