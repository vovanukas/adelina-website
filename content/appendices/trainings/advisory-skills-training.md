## Summary
In this advising training session, we looked at the ideas and theories that support good communication and advice-giving. We talked about how important it is to take into account a number of variables when providing advice, such as self-awareness, knowing the client's needs, and making sure communication is clear and efficient (Purdue University, n.d.). In order to guarantee the quality and acceptance of advice, we looked at possible communication risks and strategies to avoid them.

#### Important Topics Covered:
According to Norman Maier's theory, the degree of acceptance and the calibre of the advice determine how effective it is (Austin, 1952).

Effective communication skills combined with self-awareness, client understanding, and subject matter expertise are essential components of quality advice.

#### Methods for Offering Guidance (Garvin & Margolis, 2015):
- Tell and Explain: Giving precise directions and justifications.
- Talk and Hear: Examining various choices and talking about benefits and drawbacks.
- Participation: Actively engaging the client in the problem-solving process while addressing complex issues collaboratively.

#### Handling Resistance: 
It's important to deal with resistance when offering guidance. the tactics include recognising resistance, probing it to uncover underlying issues, and employing methods such as JUDO, which is a metaphor for refocusing resistance (European Judo Union, n.d.).

#### Emotional Regulation: 
Skillfully controlling emotions is a prerequisite for good communication. Important ideas include holding people accountable while upholding boundaries, avoiding letting emotions get in the way of communication, and remaining impartial.

## Suitability assessment
As I think back on this training, I see how crucial it is for advisors to have strong communication skills, empathy, and self-awareness. By putting these ideas into practice, I hope to improve my ability to offer sound counsel and successfully handle difficult communication situations.

## Key points for personal development
Improving articulation and listening abilities to raise the quality and acceptability of advice.

Developing emotional resilience to control emotions during difficult conversations is a key component of emotional intelligence.

The capacity to modify advice-giving strategies in accordance with the requirements and communication preferences of clients.

## Conclusion
I left this training with the fundamental abilities needed to give sound advice and communication. Through the application of theory and practical techniques, I can improve their capacity to offer sound advice and confidently navigate communication challenges.
