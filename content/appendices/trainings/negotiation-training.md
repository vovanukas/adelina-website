## Summary:
We looked at the complex field of negotiation during the training. We studied the 4-stage and 8-stage frameworks and examined negotiation as a dynamic process (Cole, 2024). We discovered the importance of the exploration and bidding stages and how they help produce outcomes that benefit both parties (Cole, 2024). We also talked about how to improve the effectiveness of negotiations through the use of research from psychology and communication studies in our strategic questioning techniques. Finally, we integrated insights from behavioural economics and negotiation ethics to discuss the significance of managing manipulation tactics (Witynski, n.d.). All things considered, the training gave us a thorough understanding of negotiation dynamics and gave us useful tools to successfully navigate negotiations.

## Suitability:
Upon reflection, I can see how the training directly relates to my negotiating style. Including the exploration and bidding phases will improve my capacity to comprehend the interests of my counterparts and provide workable solutions (Shonk, n.d.). Through the development of strategic questioning techniques, I am able to obtain important information and facilitate cooperative problem-solving (Indeed, 2023). Furthermore, being aware of manipulation strategies will enable me to negotiate assertively and morally. 

## Key points for personal development:
The Art of Negotiation Processes: Gain expertise in the four- and eight-stage negotiation models by combining knowledge from scholarly research with real-world application to modify tactics for different situations and produce positive results.

Developing Your Research Skills: Improve questioning strategies by applying research from communication studies and negotiation studies, establishing negotiations expertly to extract important information and encourage cooperative problem-solving.

Reducing Deceptive Behaviour: By using research on power dynamics and negotiation ethics, negotiating from a position of strength, building trust, and upholding professional integrity, I can cultivate an awareness of manipulation tactics.

## Conclusion:
My SMART learning goals relating to improved leadership are directly aligned with the training sessions, which offer a strong foundation for improving negotiation skills. These sessions are enhanced by insights from academic research and Robert's practical experience. I am prepared to negotiate with confidence and reach win-win agreements in a variety of professional contexts by becoming skilled in negotiation procedures, improving my questioning strategies, and minimising manipulation tactics. These realisations provide me the ability to successfully negotiate, promote teamwork, and preserve moral principlesâ€”all of which help me advance both personally and professionally.
