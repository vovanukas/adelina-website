## Summary
During this training we discussed what are group dynamics and how to navigate them. We discussed how compatible different team members are with each other and what are our strenghts and weaknesses. We did the four core quadrants that we have also used for the qualities game, to see how we can best work together as a team (Mulder, 2020). Additionally, we discussed how our character qualities affect how we perceive the world. At this point we could already see that some of us are incompatable and are likely to butt heads. Furthermore, we explored Tuckmanâ€™s group formation phases: forming, storming, norming, performing, adjourning. We are currently at the forming phase (keka, n.d.). The characteristics of it are anxiety and excitement, avoiding conflict, attempts of defining tasks, processes (West Chester University, 2022).

## Suitability assessment
After giving this experience some thought, I see how crucial it is to comprehend the phases of team development. We can proactively resolve disputes and power struggles within our group by recognising the storming phase, which promotes improved communication and alignment with our common objectives. The emphasis of this training session is on applying team development theories in real-world contexts.

## Key points
Conflict Resolution Skills: Using techniques to successfully resolve power struggles and disputes within the team.

Communication: Improving communication abilities to share emotions and worries among team members.

Team dynamics: During the storming phase, gaining a better understanding of the roles and objectives of the team.

## Conclusion
This is an example of how team development theory is put into practice. We can manage disagreements and power struggles better by identifying and resolving the storming phase in our team, which will strengthen our bond and help us work together to achieve our goals.
