## Summary
This training session was very informal, we spend it with Evgenya talking about challenges within our team - specifically with Rupina who wasn’t coming to classes or doing her parts of the assignment. We expressed our frustrations and worries about her productivity, lack of participation and what that means for us. The coach recommended we talk to her, express our feelings and give her a warning. Based on theory, this would’ve been our groups storming phase (keka, n.d.). It’s characteristics are conflict,  power struggles, increase in the clarity of purpose. 

## Suitability assessment
After giving this experience some thought, I see how crucial it is to comprehend the phases of team development. We can proactively resolve disputes and power struggles within our group by recognising the storming phase, which promotes improved communication and alignment with our common objectives. The emphasis of this training session is on applying team development theories in real-world contexts.

## Key points
Conflict Resolution Skills: Using techniques to successfully resolve power struggles and disputes within the team.

Communication: Improving communication abilities to share emotions and worries among team members.

Team dynamics: During the storming phase, gaining a better understanding of the roles and objectives of the team.

## Conclusion
This is an example of how team development theory is put into practice. We can manage disagreements and power struggles better by identifying and resolving the storming phase in our team, which will strengthen our bond and help us work together to achieve our goals.
