## First Individual PD Meeting Summary

This was my first time meeting my Personal Development coach Evgenya. We became acquainted, talked about what PD is going to look like this year, what we would need to do. We also talked about my goals for the year, how I’m going to accomplish them, where I would like to do my internship, what are my responsibilities and how I manage them. Evgenya also explained how I should do personal growth plan and that once I’m finished she can give me feedback. 

## Second Individual PD Meeting Summary

Our second meeting started a little late so we had less time to talk, but it was mostly reflecting on CA module and group work, challenges that I encountered during it. Also, how far along I’m with the PD portfolio, who I will shadow for 3 days, what are my plans for third year - particularly about minor and internship. Also, we talked about how to best do other tasks in  PD portfolio, a little about IB module and what it’s going to be like.
