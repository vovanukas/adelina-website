## Objective: 

This term I will attend all classes prepared and show enthusiasm for projects. By the end of the term I will not have any missing parts of the assignments and not have any retakes. I will achieve this by setting deadlines for assignments and dedicating an hour everyday minimum to do them.

## Acting out: 

This year I will attend all classes prepared and show enthusiasm for projects. By the end of the term I will not have any missing parts of the assignments and not have any retakes. I will achieve this by setting deadlines for assignments and dedicating an hour everyday minimum to do them. I want to focus on staying focused and not procrastinating and try out incorporating school work into my everyday life in such way that it doesn’t feel tiresome.

## Reflect:

This year I didn’t meet my objective for professional attitude. I didn’t feel enthusiastic for any projects and I had a couple of retakes. I did try to keep to my study schedule and not miss any classes, but during term 4 I had some health issues that kept me from being able to attend everything. This caused me to also lose motivation for studying. Also, I kept to my goal opf setting deadlines for myself which helped me finish everything on time and not have any missing parts when submitting assignments. Due to my health issues and lack of motivation, I procrastinated doing some of my parts which in the end only caused my more stress when the deadlines started to approach. My goal was to not have any retakes and to have good grades, but unfortunately I just couldn’t achieve it this year. This causes me to feel bad about myself especially since my biggest obstacles [see appendix 8]({{< ref "/appendices/trainings/inspiration-game/" >}}) are that I’m a control freak and the high standards that I set for myself. So having health issues that are out of my hand get in a way of my success really put a lot of stress and tension on me. Additionally, wanting to keep up with work, school, hobbies and personal life stretched me thin and just added on the stress (see challenge journal 1). I thought I would be able to do everything with a smaller time frame, but in reality I just ended up becoming more and more stressed. At times like these, I try to work harder on staying focused and completing as much as I can within a few days. 

## Awareness:

From this I can learn not to rely on motivation but on self-discipline. I need to be stricter with the time schedules I set up and with staying on top of school work so that I can have time for all other responsibilities [see challenge journal 1]({{< ref "/appendices/challenge-journals/challenge-journal-term-1/" >}}). What caused me not to meet this objective is myself - I kept procrastinating and getting distracted, forgetting about assignments like personal development and reflective assignments we had this year after each module. In conclusion, next year I need to plan a more detailed timeline of when which parts of assignments are getting done and set monthly goals. Those goals will include things like finishing a chapter in the assignment, reading a book. 

## Action plan:

Next year, I will create a detailed week-by-week timeline of all the assignments and responsibilities for the year, so that I know I will finish everything on time and won’t ever be overworked or stressed. Additionally, I might actually do some assignments in advance so that when the weather becomes better in spring I won’t have to worry about missing out on hanging out with friends to do assignments. It’s expected of me to manage my own time and myself in order to complete everything on time and so far I have done that, but it could be improved. The disadvantages of my yearly schedule is that I don’t know yet what my internship and minor will require of me, but the advantages are being better organized and never getting blindsided by a forgotten deadline. I think having a yearly timeline is best alternative for me as a person who needs structure and control over such things. My goal for next year is to be done with each deadline at least a week early and start working on assignments as soon as possible instead of procrastinating. Also, next year I want to get 80’s at my minor at Hogeschool Utrecht.

## SMART Goal for next year: 

Creating a detailed weekly schedule for assignments and responsibilities, as well as finishing some assignments ahead of time to balance academic obligations with personal life and health, will help me achieve my goals of coming to class prepared, demonstrating enthusiasm for projects, finishing assignments on time without needing to retake them, and earning grades of 80 or higher in my minor at Hogeschool Utrecht the following year.
