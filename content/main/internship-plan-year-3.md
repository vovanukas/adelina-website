In year 3, I will start my year in Utrecht Hogeschool doing an international advertising minor. My objectives there are branding strategy, cultural values and communication in an international perspective, creative research, psychology of marketing communication and a final creative assignment. I also plan to develop my leadership skills, widen my network of connections and step out of my comfort zone by going to a different university in another city alone. 
As for the internship that I will do in second half of year 3 - I hope to do a marketing internship in an international beauty or fashion company. The companies I’m currently interested in are Gisou, L’oreal and Hunkemoller. I’m interested in these companies because my personal interest are in beauty, fashion and in the future I would love to have my own beauty company. My goal is to learn how does a successful company run from the inside. During the internship, I hope to develop my professional attitude, adaptability and how to work within a corporate environment.
